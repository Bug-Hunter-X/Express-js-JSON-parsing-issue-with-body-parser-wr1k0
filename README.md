# Express.js JSON Parsing Issue
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when the application fails to correctly parse the incoming JSON data, resulting in an undefined req.body.

## Bug Description
The provided Express.js code snippet utilizes `express.json()` middleware for parsing JSON request bodies. However, despite this middleware being in place, the `req.body` remains undefined when a POST request with a JSON payload is sent to the `/data` endpoint.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `express.json()` middleware is properly positioned in the application's middleware stack *before* any route handlers that expect JSON data.
